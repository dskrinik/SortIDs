JAVA2 - Sorting IDs
Write a program that will read in a list of IDs (both numeric and alphanumeric) and write them alphabetically (natural order) into a file named output.csv.  You must sort the IDs yourself, do not use a built in sort method.

Sample Input:
7
0
1
abc
44
cat
18

DO NOT use Eclipse.  Write this code in a simple text editor and compile and run it via the command line.
